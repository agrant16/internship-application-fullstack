# Cloudflare Workers Internship Application: Full-Stack

Forked from the [Cloudflare Summer 2020 Fullstack Repo](https://github.com/cloudflare-internship-2020/internship-application-fullstack).

This is my implementation of Cloudflare's Summer 2020 Fullstack internship
coding challenge. It implements all three basic requirements as well as the
first two extra credit requirements. These requirements can be found on the
original repo's README.

The live demo of this app can be found at my [Workers.dev site.](https://internship-application-fullstack.agrant16.workers.dev)
